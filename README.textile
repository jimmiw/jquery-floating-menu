A small javascript that scrolls a menu with the window, when a user scrolls
down a long page.

To use the script, simply use the following code snippet:

    $('#my-menu').floatmenu();

The menu will now be directly below the browser's inner top.

You can also add extra padding, by giving an option to the plugin:

    $('#my-menu').floatmenu({topPadding: 10});

The menu will now be 10pixels below the browser's inner top at all times.

You can also try out the index.html file, to see a working example (remember to
download this script as well)
